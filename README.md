# OIP HD-MultiWallet
`oip-hdmw` is a full service BIP44 compatable Javascript Wallet. You can spawn and recover the entire wallet for each coin using just a single BIP-39 Mnemonic. The wallet looks up transactions from a provided `insight-api` server, and constructs transactions using that information.
